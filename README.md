# PhD Scholar at IIITD
#### Research Interests: Ethical AI, Semantic Web Technologies, Knowledge Representation, LLMs, Neurosymbolic Techniques, Ethical Reasoning, AI Philosophy

## Highlights
- Ph.D. (Computer Science Engineering) scholar at IIITD, working on developing a framework for ethical reasoning in AI systems. Currently in 5th year of study, expecting to graduate early 2026. 
- Research interests include ethical AI systems, semantic web technologies, ontology development, knowledge graphs and representation, neurosymbolic techniques, LLMs, NLP, and ethical philosophy.
- Seven years of research and industry experience in ethical AI systems, data science, and business analytics.
- Research projects include the development of an ontology that is able to capture contextual information and applied ethics using explicit entities and relationships. These can help build a discrete structure that may support dilemma resolution in applied ethics via reasoning and inference. Further work includes real-world use case modeling for evaluation of the ontology and building an augmented dataset for neurosymbolic applications, such as case-based reasoning to emulate casuistry, leveraging LLMs. The development of rules in the form of an algorithm for ethics scoring based on important ethical principles may help in reasoning and querying to analyze ethics in action-based scenarios.
