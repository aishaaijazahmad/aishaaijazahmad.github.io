### Highlights
- Ph.D. (Computer Science Engineering) scholar at IIITD, working on developing a framework for ethical AI using a neuro-symbolic approach.
- Research interests include semantic web technologies, ontology development, knowledge graphs and representation, neuro-symbolic techniques, AI ethics, and ethical philosophy.
- Three years of research and industry experience in data science, analytics, and management.
 -Future plans include the development of an ontology that is able to capture ethical theory using entities and relationships. These can help build a discrete structure that may support dilemma resolution in applied ethics. Further work includes real-world use case modeling for evaluation of the ontology. In addition to this, the development of rules for important ethical principles will help in reasoning and querying for analyzing ethics in action-based scenarios.

### Research Projects
Ongoing:
#### APPL-E: An Applied Ethics Ontology to capture Ethical Theory and Contextual Information in various Domains
An Ontology to capture various abstract concepts in the field of ethical philosophy as entities and relationships.

#### A Dataset to Capture Ethical and Contextual Information about Real-world Cases with their Ethical Analysis
This dataset aims to document and annotate real-world cases where some moral reasoning takes place. The features selected for this dataset are carefully curated to represent the most vital contextual information that can imply the morality of the act. Each act can be labeled as either a morally right, wrong, or grey action. Ethical theory is also considered as schools of thought and the ethical principles violated. This dataset may facilitate ethics research in the field of AI applications and also aid ML and symbolic techniques for dilemma resolution. 

#### A Survey on Techniques to Digitize Ethics and Ethical Decision-making
This survey paper looks at the various techniques used to capture ethical information in the computing space, and also the use of the latest technologies to facilitate ethical decision-making.
